## How Does It Work? üåü

**MicroStream** simplifies communication between microservices using a **centralized hub-and-spoke architecture**, also known as a **star network**. In this model, the **[MicroStream Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** acts as the central communication point, and your microservices, equipped with the **[MicroStream Client](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-client)**, connect to the Hub and communicate through it.

Here's how it works:

### üåü The Star Network Concept

Imagine a star:

- The **center of the star** is the **[MicroStream Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)**.
- The **points of the star** are your **microservices** (each equipped with the **[MicroStream Client](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-client)**).

![MicroStream Star Network Diagram](https://mermaid.ink/svg/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggVERcbiAgICBIdWJbTWljcm9TdHJlYW0gSHViXSAtLT4gU2VydmljZTFbU2VydmljZSAxXVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTJbU2VydmljZSAyXVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTNbU2VydmljZSAzXVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTRbU2VydmljZSA0XVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTVbU2VydmljZSA1XVxuIiwibWVybWFpZCI6eyJ0aGVtZSI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJsaW5lV2lkdGgiOiIzIn19)

In this setup:

- The **Hub** acts as the central communication point.
- **Services** (nodes) connect to the Hub and communicate through it, **not directly with each other**.

### üöÄ How It Works in Practice

1. **Service Registration**:

   - Each microservice connects to the Hub using the **[MicroStream Client](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-client)**.
   - The **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** automatically detects and registers the service.

2. **Request-Response Communication in Real-Time**:

   - When **Service A** needs to talk to **Service B**, it sends a request to the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)**.
   - The **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** routes the request to **Service B**.
   - **Service B** processes the request and sends a response back through the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)**.
   - All communication happens in **real-time** over WebSockets, ensuring fast and reliable data exchange.

3. **Auto-Discovery**:

   - Once connected, the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** keeps track of all connected services, so you don‚Äôt need to manually configure connections between services. However, you still need to specify the target service and method when sending a request.

4. **Heartbeat Mechanism**:
   - Services send regular "heartbeats" to the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** to confirm they‚Äôre active.
   - If a service stops sending heartbeats, the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** removes it from the network.

### ‚ú® Why Choose MicroStream?

**MicroStream** is designed to make microservice communication **simple**, **efficient**, and **scalable**. Here‚Äôs why you‚Äôll love it:

- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required to get started.
- **Real-Time Request-Response Communication**: Built on WebSockets for instant, reliable data exchange.
- **Auto-Service-Management**: Once connected, the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** keeps track of all services, simplifying network management.
- **Scalable**: Easily add more services without reconfiguring the network.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to traditional REST or gRPC.
- **Flexible**: Works seamlessly with any microservice architecture.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```bash
npm install microstream-client
```

<hr>

## Usage üöÄ

```javascript
const { MicrostreamClient } = require("microstream-client");

// Create a new MicrostreamClient instance with the necessary configuration
const client = new MicrostreamClient({
  hubUrl: "http://localhost:3000", // URL of the Microstream Hub
  serviceName: "auth-service", // Name of your service - it has to be unique
  logLevel: "debug", // Enable debug logs
});

// Register a handler for incoming requests for event 'authenticate'
client.onRequest("authenticate", (data) => {
  console.log("Received authentication request:", data);
  return { success: true, token: "sample-token" }; // Respond to the request
});

// Register another handler for incoming request for another event
client.onRequest("another-event", (data) => {
  console.log("Received another-event request:", data);
  return { success: true, data: "sample-data" }; // Respond to the request
});

//  Send a request to 'jwt-service' and handle the response
try {
  const response = await client.sendRequest("jwt-service", "generate_jwt", {
    userID: 123,
  });
  console.log("Received response:", response);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error:", error.message);
}

//  Send a request to 'profile-service' and handle the response
try {
  const response = await client.sendRequest(
    "profile-service",
    "fetch-profile-by-userID",
    { userID: 123 }
  );
  console.log("Received response:", response);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error:", error.message);
}
```

### Explanation üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

1. **Configuration**: The [`MicrostreamClient`](#microstreamclientoptions) is configured with the URL of the [Microstream Hub](#microstream-hub-), the unique registration name of your service, and the log level.
2. **Registering Handlers**: The `onRequest` method is used to register a handler for incoming requests. In this example, handlers respond to "authenticate" and "another-event" events.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `event`: The event name to listen for.
     - `handler`: The function to handle the request. It receives the request data and returns the response.
3. **Sending Requests**: The `sendRequest` method is used to send a request to another service. In this example, requests are sent to the "jwt-service" to generate a JWT and to the "profile-service" to fetch a profile by user ID.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `targetService`: The name of the target service.
     - `event`: The event name to trigger on the target service.
     - `data`: Optional data to send with the request.
   - **Returns**: A promise that resolves with the response from the target service.
   - **Error Handling**: The `sendRequest` method is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the request. For example, if a request is sent to an invalid service, the [Hub](#microstream-hub-) will respond with an error, which will be received by the client and thrown accordingly. The catch block will catch the error, and the user can display it using the `error.message` property.

## Configuration Options ‚öôÔ∏è

### MicrostreamClientOptions

- `hubUrl`: URL of the Microstream Hub.
- `serviceName`: A Unique Service Registation Name of the service connecting to the hub.
- `timeout`: Timeout for requests in milliseconds (default: 5000).
- `heartbeatInterval`: Interval for sending heartbeats in milliseconds (default: 5000).
- [`logLevel`](#log-levels-): Log level for the client (default: "info").

### Important Notes üìù

- **Service names** must be **unique** across your entire system. The Hub will reject any connection attempts from services trying to register with an already registered name.
- If your service attempts to connect with a name that's already registered:
  - The connection will be rejected
  - An error will be thrown with code `DUPLICATE_SERVICE_REGISTRATION`
  - The process will automatically terminate to prevent conflicts

## Log Levels üìä

- `debug`: Log everything (useful for development).
- `info`: Log info, warnings, and errors.
- `warn`: Log warnings and errors.
- `error`: Log only errors.
- `silent`: Disable all logs.
